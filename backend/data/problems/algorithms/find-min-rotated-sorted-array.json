  "description": "Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:\n\n- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated 4 times.\n- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated 7 times.\n\nNotice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]]` one time results in `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-2]]`.\n\nGiven the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return the **minimum element** of this array.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.",

    {"input": "nums = [11, 13, 15, 17]", "output": "11", "explanation": "The original array was not rotated (or rotated by its length)."}
